# basic_edge_detection
Using python to do basic edge detection on photos for a small project

Used scikit image packages to do most of the legwork for this script (Documentation here: https://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/api/api.html)

how to use:
python detect_edge.py <filename>
  
Running the program will open a window showing both Robert's and Sobel's edge detection side by side. The edge detected images will be saved under roberts-<filename> and sobel-<filename> respectively.
